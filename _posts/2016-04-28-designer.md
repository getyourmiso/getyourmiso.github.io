We are trying to build a world class product team at Miso. While we have product-market fit with our service, we still consider this day one. In fact, we are looking for our first designer to join the family. You will have to be hands on in multiple areas from branding to mobile apps to advertisements to print materials and more. As you can tell, this role is not suited for the faint of heart.

You will work among design oriented engineers, product managers and marketers in a fast-paced, rapidly growing environment. The role demands an ability to get things done no matter what the task, bold innovation and an obsession with quality.

<strong>You might be a good fit if...</strong>
<ul>
	<li>You believe in craftsmanship and create elegant and compelling designs, over and over.</li>
	<li>You can help define requirements as opposed to simply just translating them into designs.</li>
	<li>Analytics don’t scare you and you know how to blend creativity with analytical thinking.</li>
</ul>

<strong>Benefits</strong>
<ul>
	<li>Equity compensation plan</li>
	<li>Create branding which will be highly recognized and featured on TV</li>
	<li>Fantastic opportunity to grow with the team</li>
	<li>Free cleanings so you can benefit from your work</li>
</ul>
