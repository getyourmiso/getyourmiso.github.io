We are trying to build a world class engineering team at Miso. While we have product-market fit with our service, we still consider this day one. We are seeking a strong iOS developer who is excited about mobile development, committed to thoughtful design, and like tackling problems on a small, fast-moving team.

	<li>Equity compensation plan</li>
	<li>Rare opportunity to make an impact such that everyone around you is using the product you built</li>
	<li>Fantastic opportunity to grow with the team</li>
	<li>Free cleanings so you can benefit from your work</li>
</ul>
